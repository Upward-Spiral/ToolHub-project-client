Repository for the final project (client) - Ironhack web development bootcamp (Feb 2020)



# ToolHub (front-end)
### This project is built using React and React-Bootstrap. Google API is used for GeoCoding and Map.

ToolHub is a hub for searching, finding, and borrowing/lending tools. People can offer the tools they don't use at the moment to be borrowed by others who need them for a project. They can also search trough the tools that others have offered, find the right one, and request to borrow (or reserve, based on the availability).
